The age old classic known by all, coded in python with pygame as a quick programming project.

Mark all the mines (right click) without setting any off, whilst clearing the grid to get clues as to where they are (left click to clear a square). Enter your name and choose a grid size to save your best time at the end.

Uses Python 3.
Required modules: pygame, sqlite3

To use, download all files and run the main file. Database will be created from scratch if it doesn't exist.
